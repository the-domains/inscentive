      In 1984, a researcher named Roger Ulrich noticed a curious pattern among
      patients who were recovering from gallbladder surgery at a suburban
      hospital in Pennsylvania. Those who had been given rooms overlooking a
      small stand of deciduous trees were being discharged almost a day sooner,
      on average, than those in otherwise identical rooms whose windows faced a
      wall.

  One of the most desirable and rare raw ingredients found in perfumery is
  agarwood, popularly referred to as oud or oudh. The indescribably deep, woody,
  balsamic scent of oud comes from the immune defense of the Aquliaria tree
  species found throughout Southeast Asia.
